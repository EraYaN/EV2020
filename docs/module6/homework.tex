\section{question 1}
Bandwidth: The width of the frequency band.
Capacity: The amount of bits that can be send per second without an error occurring. 
Data rate: Data transmission in bit/sec.
The relation between the bandwidth, capacity and the data rate is that the amount of data that can be send per second, without an error accurring, is dependent on the bandwidth. See also equation \ref{eq:bandwidth}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bandwidth}
C= B log_{2}(1+\frac{S}{N})
\end{equation}
