\chapter{Assignment 1}
The bluetooth connection was made by first pairing the PC with KITT. Then, the pre-compiled MATLAB file from blackboard helped to connect with KITT and request for status updates. By measuring the time it took to receive one status update, the bluetooth delay was calculated. The MATLAB tic and toc functions were used to measure this delays.
\\ \\
The first test was on KITT being next to the PC's bluetooth module, making the delay minimal. The result was 0.1344 msec with a standard deviation of 0.0016 msec, using about 20 test samples. Surprisingly, the second test with KITT and the PC's bluetooth module about eight meters apart, resulted in 0.1241 msec with a standard deviation of 0.0011 msec, also using about 20 test samples. This could be explained by the presence or absence of other bluetooth connections, which might cause interference.
\\ \\
The maximal distance for the bluetooth to be connected was found to be about ten meters.
