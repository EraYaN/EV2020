\chapter{Introduction}
With renewable energy rapidly becoming more and more important, cars of the future will see a major overhaul. 
An increasing amount of cars become hybrid or fully electric. 
To become familiar with this development an R/C car is modified to become smart and 'green'.
KITT, as the R/C car is called, features a wireless charging system, an anti-collision system and is able to autonomously drive in a straight line. 
Certain requirements are to be met regarding these properties. 
The aim is to optimize every property and preferably exceed the requirements.
\\\\
Via the wireless charging system ten 350F-supercapacitors in series should be charged in less than 4 minutes. 
This system will be implemented with the use of coils seperated by a 6 cm distance. 
The input voltage is 18V and the supercapacitors should be charged to 20V. 
Furthermore, KITT should be able to bridge a 3 meter distance to a wall within 3 seconds. 
At less than 10 cm of the wall KITT should come to a standstill.
