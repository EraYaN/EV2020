\chapter{Labday 1: Basic filtering}
\label{ch:labday1}
\section{Channel inpulse response}
In a 2-dimentional room of 4x4 m, a transmitter and a receiver are placed at (1.2, 0.3) and (3.1, 3.3) respectively.
In this section the propagation of a delta impulse, from TX to RX, is being investagated.
During propagation, the signal is damped as function of the propagated distance $R$. 
The speed of sound varies as function of temperature, humidity and air pressure, but we can assume is it 340m/s. 
For the attenuation $\alpha$(r) of the signal can be found with the use of the following equation:

\begin{equation}
	\alpha (r) = \frac{\beta}{r^2}
\label{eq:damping}
\end{equation}

In Eqaution \ref{eq:damping} $\beta$ is the damping over a reference distance of 1 meter. 
\\
\\
The direct path to the RX point is the fastest and the strongest and can easily be calculated.
The indirect paths, however, are more difficult to calculate.
The indirect paths are the results of reflections and can be calculated by looking at the mirror images of the TX and RX over the edges of the room. 
To find the first order reflections only one mirror image of either the TX or the RX is needed. 
We choose to mirror the TX.
The mirrored image of the TX and the original RX are connected, which always results in an intersection with a wall.
Since there are four walls, four virtual sources are created this way when looking at first order reflections.
This location at the wall is the point where the single bounce is made, connecting this point with both the RX and TX will be the total path.
\\ 
\\
In order to find the second order reflections we needed to mirror both the TX and the RX as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:mirror}.
In this figure also the first order reflections are displayed. 
This is because the TX is not only present as the mirrored image, but also as the non-mirrored version. 
The connection between the mirror image might intersect with the room.
It either intersects with two walls or none. 
This is because both mirror images are outside the room.
When there is an intersection, we have two point on two different walls. 
Via these two point the delta pulse will bounce from the TX to the RX. 
When we mirrored the TX and RX over all the walls, we got 16 combinations, but not all of these intersect with the room. 
Some of them connected outside the wall, this means that it is not possible to bounce via the two walls. 
When looking closely at Figure \ref{fig:connected}, we see that only 8 of the 16 paths are possible, meaning that we get 8 virutal sources form the second order reflections. 
\\ 
\\
As explained before the second oreder reflection paths were drawn by connecting the two wall intersections. 
When we calculate the length of all the direct and indirect (reflected) paths and we use the speed of sound, we can calculate the delay of each path.
With the help of Equation \ref{eq:damping} we are able to calculate the resulting amplitude. 
We used a $\beta$ of 1.00 since the outcome of all amplitudes would give us the total received signal compared to a infinitely large room with the TX and RX 1 meter away from each other.
In Figure \ref{fig:response} we displayed the resulting delta impulse response over time. 
With the Matlab script in Appendix \ref{lst:report1.m}, we got a resulting amplitude of 0.5420. 
This is equal to the sum of all delta impulse response amplitudes in Figure \ref{fig:response}.

\section{More general filters}
We now have to look at a filter that can damp different frequencies. 
An example of such a filter can be seen in Equation \ref{eq:filters}.

\begin{equation}
H(z) = \dfrac{1}{1 + az^{-1}}, \quad (|a| < 1)
\label{eq:filters}
\end{equation}

The Matlab scripts we used to plot the figures are included in Appendix Listing \ref{lst:report2.m}.
\\
x(t) consists of the first five seconds ($44100\cdot5 ~\mathrm{samples}$) of the file /bin/Sound/music/interface/Noddinagushpa.mp3 from a Age of Empires III installation, this title screen theme.
It is kind of a pompous drum roll.
\\
\\

In Figure \ref{fig:a0.95-plots} the impulse response of the filter in Equation \ref{eq:filters} is plotted for a = 0.95. 
In Figure \ref{fig:a0.-95-plots} shows the impulse response of the filter for a value of a = -0.95.
From the figures we can clearly see that for a value of a = 0.95 the filter enhanceses the signal at frequencies $\omega = \pi + 2n \pi$ and for a = -0.95 the signals are enhanced for the frequencies $\omega = 2n \pi$. 
When we give the input a different, more general signal, than this signal will also be enhanced at the previously named frequencies. 
\\
\\
For the question why there is no Matlab function "FT" or "DTFT" to compute a (discrete-time) Fourier transform, we can best look at Equation \ref{eq:DTFT} and \ref{eq:DFT}.
Matlab uses numeric calculations, so when assuming we have an infinite amount of frequencies, which is the case with the "DTFT", this can cause problems. 
In the formula for the "DFT", however, we use a finite amount of frequencies, Matlab does support this, so that is why Matlab does have a function that can do the DFT, but not the "FT" or "DTFT".


\begin{equation}
X_{DFT} = \sum_{N} x_N[n]e^{-j2\pi \dfrac{kn}{N}} \quad \quad k = 0, 1, \dots, N - 1 \quad \text{DFT}\\
\label{eq:DFT}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
X(\omega) = \sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} x[n]e^{-j2\pi fn} \quad \text{DTFT}\\
\label{eq:DTFT}
\end{equation}

    	\label{fig:a0.-95-plots}
\end{figure}


\section{Time domain and frequency domain}
Now the train signal has to be plotted in the time- and frequency domain.
The written Matlab-code can be found in Appendix \ref{lst:timefreqdomain.m}.
Before plotting the time domain signal we had to take into account the sample rate $Fs$.
In order to find the length of the train signal we used the formula:
\begin{equation}
t = \frac{samples}{Fs}
\end{equation}
In the script $length(y)$ is used instead of $samples$.

The plot for the time domain signal can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:timedomain} and the plot for the frequency domain signal can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:freqdomain}.


\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\setlength\figureheight{6cm}
    	\setlength\figurewidth{10cm}
	\input{resources/labday1/timefreq1.tikz}
	\caption{The train signal in the time domain.}
	\label{fig:timedomain}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\setlength\figureheight{6cm}
  	\setlength\figurewidth{10cm}
	\input{resources/labday1/timefreq2.tikz}
	\caption{The train signal in the frequency domain.}
	\label{fig:freqdomain}
\end{figure}

\section{Time-frequency plot}
The used train signal is not stationary, because the frequency changes over time. 
So it does not make sense to record second or hours of an audio signal and then take the DFT of the complete sequence. 
Instead we splitted the signal into short segments of approximately 20 $ms$ and then we did the DFT on each segment. 
This resulted in the time-frequncy plot show in Figure \ref{fig:timefreq}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{resources/labday1/timefrequentieplot.png}
\caption{Time-frequency plot.}
\label{fig:timefreq}
\end{figure}



\section{Zero padding}
Sometimes, the number of samples in a time-domain signal \textbf{x} is not very large. 
In frequency domain using the DFT, obtain the same number of samples as in time domain, and in these cases the resolution is not high.
'Zero padding' can be used to obtain a higher resolution.
Essentially, \textbf{x} (or \textbf{h}) is augmented with a lot of zeros.
After that only the DFT has to be applied to the augmented sequence. 

Firstly we use the filter in Equation \ref{eq:filter}. 
We don't apply the zero padding here (yet). 
A plot of this amplitude spectrum can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:zeropadding1}.

\begin{equation}
h = [1\quad zeros(1,5)\quad 0.9\quad zeros(1,5)\quad 0.8];
\label{eq:filter}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\setlength\figureheight{6cm}
  	\setlength\figurewidth{10cm}
	\input{resources/zeropadding1.tikz}
	\caption{The amplitude spectrum with only the available samples.}
	\label{fig:zeropadding1}
\end{figure}

After plotting Figure \ref{fig:zeropadding1} we apply the 'zero padding' on the filter. 
In order to do this \textbf{h} is extended with $3\times 13 = 39$ zeros to 4 times its original length.
For the new found values we used the plot maker '+'.
In Figure \ref{fig:zeropadding2} the results of both plots are shown. 
From the figure we can conclude that we have obtained interpolation, because every 4th sample coincides with a sample from the previous plot (also see Figure \ref{fig:zeropadding1}).

  	\setlength\figurewidth{10cm}

	\label{fig:zeropadding2}
\end{figure}


\section{The convolution property}
Here in this chapter the convolution property is demonstrated. 
This can be done by showing that Equation \ref{eq:convprop} holds.

\begin{equation}
y[n] = x[n]\star h[n] \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad Y(\omega) = X(\omega)H(\omega) 
\label{eq:convprop}
\end{equation}

To check this property we calculate $Y(\omega)$ and $X(\omega)H(\omega)$ separately and we check if both results are the same. 
We let the original signals \textbf{x} and \textbf{h} convolve with each other.
We then get the signaal $y[n]$, then, by using the DFT we get the $Y(\omega)$.\\
Now we only need to find the second part, the $X(\omega)H(\omega)$ part, respectively.
We do this by using zero padding to give both signals \textbf{x} and \textbf{h} the same length. 
If we then use DFT on our signals and use point to point multiplication, we obtain  $X(\omega)H(\omega)$.\\
Lastely we plot the absolute values in the frequencydomain. 
In Figure \ref{fig:convpro} we see two results. 
The first plot is the amplitude plot of  $X(\omega)H(\omega)$ in the frequencydomain and the second plot is the amplitude of $Y(\omega)$, also in the frequencydomain.
The plots are equal to each other, which means that convolution property holds.
