\section*{Labday 1: Basic filtering in time domain and frequency domain}
\subsection*{Report 1: Channel impulse response}
In a 2-dimensional room of 4x4 m, a transmitter and a receiver are placed at (1.2, 0.3) and (3.1, 3.3) resp.
The propagation of a delta impulse from TX to RX is being investigated with the use of the following equation:

\begin{equation}
	\alpha (r) = \frac{\beta}{r^2}
\label{eq:damping}
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is the damping over a reference distance of 1 meter.
\\ \\
The direct path is fastest and strongest at the RX point and can be calculated directly.
The indirect paths, as a result of reflections, can be calculated by looking at the mirror images of the TX and RX over the edges of the room.
For the first order reflections, only one mirror image is needed of either the RX or TX.
We choose to mirror the RX.
The mirrored image of the TX and the original RX are connected, which always results in an intersection with a wall.
Since there are four walls, four virtual sources are created this way when looking at first order reflections.
This location at the wall is the point where the single bounce is made, connecting this point with both the RX and TX will be the total path.
\\ \\
Second order reflections are calculated by mirroring both the TX and RX as displayed in Figure \ref{fig:mirror}.
Note that also the first order reflections are displayed in this figure since the TX is also present as non-mirrored version.
The connection between the mirror images might intersect with the room.
The connection either intersects with two walls or none, since both mirror images are outside the room.
When there are intersections, the two points on the two different walls are the two points via which the delta impulse bounces exactly to the RX from the TX.
The TX and RX are mirrored over all walls in all 16 combinations, but not all of them intersect with the room, which states that it is not possible to bounce via this two walls.
By inspecting Figure \ref{fig:connected}, it is clear that only 8 paths of the total 16 are possible, making 8 virtual sources from second order reflections.
\\ \\
The second order reflection paths are drawn by connecting the two wall intersections, the RX with the intersection at the wall it was reflected over and the TX with the intersection at its wall.
When the length of all direct and reflected paths are measured and using the speed of sound, the delay of each path can be calculated.
Also, using Eq. \ref{eq:damping}, the resulting amplitude can be calculated.
We used a $\beta$ of 1.00 since the outcome of all amplitudes would give the total received signal compared to a infinitely large room with the TX and RX 1 meter from each other.
The resulting delta impulse response over time is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:response}.
Using the Matlab script from Appendix A, a resulting total amplitude of 0.5420, which equals the sum of all delta impulse response amplitudes from Figure \ref{fig:response}.

\section*{Report 3}

In MatLab the standard train file is loaded. 
Subsequently the time and frequency domain signals are plotted as seen in figure \ref{fig:train_time} and figure \ref{fig:train_freq}. 
For the time axis vector a linearly spaced vector of the same size as the vector y from the train file is used. 
The plot of the frequency domain signal is the result of a fast Fourier transformation.

The symmetry might be explained because the train file is a real audio signal. 
Negative frequencies point to complex sinusoids. 
If the plot would not be symmetrical that would mean negative frequencies influence the audio signal. 
Instead if the plot is symmetrical the real and imaginary frequency components overlap and thus there is no significant influence of negative frequencies.\\
This is also why it would make sense to only plot positive frequencies.
To accomplish this one should take the absolute value of the frequency axis vector.

\section*{Report 4}

Figure \ref{fig:timefreq} is a time frequency plot of the train signal. 
The signal is spitted into 20 ms seconds whereafter the FFT is applied on each segment.
It can be seen that mainly the frequencies around 2,5 Hz are prominent and that there is a moment of silence around 0,5 seconds. 
This is in agreement with figure \ref{fig:train_time} and figure \ref{fig:train_freq}.

\section*{Report 5 \& 6}

Sometimes the resolution might not be very high. 
To address this issue we consider zero padding.
This is basically augmenting a signal with zeros.
Subsequently the original samples will be interpolated.
In figure \ref{fig:zeropadding} an amplitude spectrum is shown.
The circles point to a Fourier transformed impulse response without zero padding, while the pluses indicate that zero padding has been applied.
Interpolation is obtained as every 4th sample coincides with a sample of the non augmented impulse response.

\section*{Report 7}
To demonstrate the convolution property, as noted in equation \ref{eq:convolution}, $X(\omega)H(\omega)$ should be identical to $Y(\omega)$.
\begin{equation}
y[n] = x[n] * h[n] \Leftrightarrow Y(\omega) = X(\omega)H(\omega)
\label{eq:convolution}
\end{equation}
For this reason we convolute the vectors x and h to get an y. 
Afterwards we apply the Fourier transform on y.
Parallel to this x and h are Fourier transformed after which they are multiplied.
This should result in identical plots.
For the latter case x and h should have the length of y.
To obtain the right length we make use of zero padding.
In figure \ref{fig:convolution} the two plots are identical and thus the convolution property is demonstrated.
