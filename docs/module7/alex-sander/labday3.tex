\section*{Labday 3: audio channel measurements}
\subsection*{Report 11}
Using the default values of Rx\_TX = 22.050 and Fs\_RX = 22.050, the inpulse response of Figure \ref{fig:response_1} was found. rerww
The time response is not an ideal delta pulse since the loudspeaker, the microphone and the channel act as filters which distort the signal.
The rising edge is rather steep, but the falling edge oscillates towards the amplitude of zero.
The spectrum of this signal is shown below the time-domain impulse response.
The distortion is also visible in this spectrum since a lot of noise peaks are also present.
In the ideal case of flat spectral transfer functions, the following spectrum would occur:

\begin{equation}
	\delta(t) \xrightarrow{\mathfrak{F}} 1
\end{equation}

The plots of Figure \ref{fig:response_2} and \ref{fig:response_3} show the effect of varying the Fs\_RX and Fs\_TX.
When using a high Fs\_RX compared to the Fs\_TX, the spectrum will become flatter and thus more ideal as seen in Figure \ref{fig:response_2}.
Vice versa, when the Fs\_TX is high compared to the Fs\_RX, the spectrum will become less flat and thus less ideal as seen in Figure \ref{fig:response_3}.
This can be explained by looking at the transfer functions of the loudspeaker and the microphone, which are both non-linear bandpass filters causing high frequencies to be damped drastically.
\\ \\
When the Fs\_RX is relatively low compared to the Fs\_TX, aliasing might occur since the delta function contains all frequencies ideally.
Using the default setting of Fs\_RX of 22.050 Hz and varying the Fs\_TX, the spectrums were analyzed for aliasing.
However, no aliasing seemed to occur, even at a Fs\_TX of 176.4 kHz, which is the highest supported frequency, aliasing could not be found as seen in Figure \ref{fig:highest_freq}.
It seems that the sound card removes these aliasings from the input signal.
This information is good to know for when analyzing the data from the audio beacon later on.

Due to propagation delay through the air, the impulse is not instantly from the loudspeaker to the microphone.
This propagation is with the speed of sound, 340 m/s.
Theoretically, the sample frequency to achieve a accuracy of 1 cm must be $2 ~[cm] ~/~ 340 ~[m/s] = 17.000 ~ Hz$.
Since this exact sample frequency is not available, the next frequency of 22.050 Hz is used.
Using three test points, 1, 25, 50, 75 and 100 cm, the delay is measured of which the results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:1cm}, \ref{fig:50cm} and \ref{fig:100cm} Table \ref{tab:distances}.
All test points were tested 25 times using a Matlab script (Appendex A:report12.m) which also calculates the mean and standard deviation of the results.

From the delay mean at distance 1 cm, it is clear that there is a large delay which is not due to the propagation through the air.
This delay is caused by the software latency in Matlab, hardware delays in the sound card, hardware delays in the microphone and again delays in the sound card and Matlab.
These delays add up to a serious amount, which might be variable as well.
Looking at the test data, and the fact of having a theoretical accuracy of less than 1 cm, it can be concluded that the delays other than the air delay are variable and disturbing the measurement.
It can be concluded from the mean plot of Figure \ref{fig:means} and the time delay standard deviations from Table \ref{tab:distances}, that the distance can not be calculated accurately from the time delay.

\subsection*{Report 15}
To pick the optimal beacon signal, it is important to look at the autocorrelation, which is defined as:

\begin{equation}
	R_x(n) = x(-n) * x(n)
\end{equation}

The autocorrelation must ideally be a delta peak to achieve the best matched filter results since the following approximation is used in matched filtering:

\begin{equation}
	x(-n) * y(n) = h(n) * R_x(n) \approx h(n) * \delta (n)
\end{equation}

To define an alternative, more criteria were introduced.
Firstly, the first and last bit of the code must be ones and the second and before-last be zeros to have a clear start and ending of the signal.
Secondly, the code must vary enough between zeros and ones, but not in a certain pattern.
This criteria, plus the original criteria of the delta-like autocorrelation resulted in the code \emph{e65a20e5}.
\\ \\
The default autocorrelation is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:default-correlation} and the alternative in Figure \ref{fig:own-correlation}.
The default autocorrelation shows a slimmer autocorrelation, but it contains high peaks around its main peak.
These peaks are way more likely to cause errors because they are almost as high as at thesame location as the main peak.
For that reason, we allowed more smaller peaks further away from the main peak to reduce the peak hight near the main peak.
This way the main peak can be depicted a lot easier, likely to result in better matched filter results later on.
