\section{Labday 3: audio channel measurements}
Using the default values of Rx\_TX = 22050 and Fs\_RX = 22050, the inpulse response of Figure \ref{fig:response_1} was found.
The time reponse is not an ideal delta pulse since the loudspeaker, the microphone and the channel act as filters which distort the signal.
The rising edge is rather steep, but the falling edge oscillates towards the amplitude of zero.
The spectrum of this signal is shown below the time-domain impulse response.
The distortion is also visible in this spectrum since a lot of noise peaks are also present.
In the ideal case of flat spectral transfer functions, the following spectrum would occur:

\begin{equation}
	\delta(t) \xrightarrow{\mathfrak{F}} 1
\end{equation}
\\ \\
The plots of Figure \ref{fig:response_2} and \ref{fig:response_3} show the effect of varying the Fs\_RX and Fs\_TX.
When using a high Fs\_RX compared to the Fs\_TX, the spectrum will become flatter and thus more ideal as seen in Figure \ref{fig:response_2}.
Vice versa, when the Fs\_TX is high compared to the Fs\_RX, the spectrum will become less flat and thus less ideal as seen in Figure \ref{fig:response_3}.
This can be explained by looking at the transfer functions of the loudspeaker and the microphone, which are both non-linear bandpass filters causing high frequencies to be damped drastically.
\\ \\
When the Fs\_RX is relatively low compared to the Fs\_TX, aliasing might occur since the delta function contains all frequencies ideally.
Using the default setting of Fs\_RX of 22.050 Hz and varying the Fs\_TX, the spectums were analysed for aliasing.
However, no aliasing seemed to occur, even at a Fs\_TX of 176.4 kHz, which is the highest supported frequency, aliasing could not be found as seen in Figure \ref{fig:highest_freq}.
It seems that the sound card removes these aliasings from the input signal.
This information is good to know for when analysing the data from the audio beacon later on.
