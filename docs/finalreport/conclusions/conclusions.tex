\chapter{Conclusions}

The integration of the system was done in such way that the program is ready for the next quarter.
The system is capable of stopping at a reasonable distance from the wall, our second try on the mid-term test was "a little over 10 cm".
It can do this within the time limit.
\\ \\
The wireless charging system works as intended since it can fully charge the capacitor bank and goes to over-voltage protection when being overcharged.
Also, when the car is removed from the charging spot, the charger goes into over-current protection, which as well indicates a solid resonance.
The target charging time was however not reached, taking about one minute too long.
We plan on improving this charging time by replacing the diodes and adjusting the compensating capacitors to better match the calculated values.
