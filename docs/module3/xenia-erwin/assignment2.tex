\chapter{Assignment 2: Feedback controller design}
\label{ch:mod3-ass2}
\section{Task 4}
\label{sec:mod3-tsk4}
We placed the poles for the $A’$ and $C’$ matrices on a more arbitrary number and far and foremost a number futher to the left.
Because the model we use to simulate the system (figure \ref{fig:simulink-model}) is “perfect” is a sense that two of the same systems give the same output.
We could not really test the L matrix’s influence.
We choose to place both poles at -20 using the acker function in MATLAB.
\begin{equation}
L=
\begin{bmatrix}
  37.238 \\
  705.24
 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
In the simulation $y-\hat{y}=0$, because of the lack of difference between the systems.
When a constant offset or noise is introduced in the $y$ signal then the influence of L is noticable.
The effect in practice will futher determine the refinement of the L matrix.
\section{Task 5}
\label{sec:mod3-tsk5}
We placed the poles of the system found in chapter \ref{ch:mod3-ass1} both at -1.3808 using the acker function in MATLAB.
The result is shown in figure \ref{fig:KITT-input-output-model-output-after-pole-placing}.
The closed loop respone is critically damped as shown in figure \ref{fig:model-step-response}.
The system also contains a zero at -0.4184.
The poles should not be too close to the zero, then the model start behaving in a weird way often exploding towards infinity.
So we started with the poles somewhere at -2.5 and then we moved them gradually to the right all the overshoot in the models output was gone.
Because the zero is in the right hand pane, so with a negative real part, this does not really intoduce any weird artefacts in the simulation.
So in the end the simulation converges faily quickly but not too quickly (in around 2.5 seconds).
If the model converged too quickly KITT would, due to the slow update rate, overshoot the desired position.

\begin{equation}
K=
\begin{bmatrix}
  -0.064057 & -0.020791
 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
And the resulting A matrix. $A’=A-KB$
\begin{equation}
A’=
\begin{bmatrix}
   -1.5405& 0.50000\\
   -0.050981 &  -1.2212
 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
This clearly is no longer in observability canonical form.
